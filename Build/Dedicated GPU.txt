For 1080p/1440p gaming, best GPUs for this system:

* **NVIDIA RTX 4060** – low power (\~115W), DLSS 3
* **AMD RX 7600** – similar performance, cheaper
* **NVIDIA RTX 3060** – older, still solid

All safe with 400W PSU. Go RTX 4060 if budget allows.

If you game on console like me, buying a dedicated GPU is pointless for audio/mixing tasks and a waste of money.
